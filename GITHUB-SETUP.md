# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## What Has Been Done

1. The project has been prepared for GitHub:
   - Git has been initialized in the project directory
   - A remote repository URL has been configured: https://github.com/josepharuja/city-letter-finder.git
   - The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude `node_modules` and other unnecessary files
   - All files have been committed to the local Git repository

2. Attempts to push to the GitHub repository were unsuccessful due to authentication issues or because the repository might not exist yet.

## How to Complete the Setup

### Option 1: If the Repository Doesn't Exist Yet

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Create a new repository named `city-letter-finder` at https://github.com/new
   - Set the repository owner to `josepharuja`
   - Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. Push your local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # From the project directory
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password
   - If you have two-factor authentication enabled, use a personal access token instead of your password

### Option 2: If the Repository Already Exists

1. Ensure you have the correct permissions to push to the repository
2. Push your local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # From the project directory
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password
   - If you have two-factor authentication enabled, use a personal access token instead of your password

### Using a Personal Access Token (Recommended)

If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account, you'll need to use a personal access token:

1. Generate a personal access token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Give it a name, select the "repo" scope
   - Click "Generate token" and copy the token

2. Use the token when pushing:
   ```bash
   # When prompted for password, use the token instead
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Verifying the Push

After pushing, visit https://github.com/josepharuja/city-letter-finder to verify that your code has been successfully pushed to the repository.
