# GitHub Repository Setup

## Issue Description

The original repository was too large to push to GitHub, resulting in an HTTP 400 error during the push operation. This was likely due to the inclusion of large files or directories in the Git history, such as the `node_modules` directory.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1. **Analyzed the repository size and content**:
   - Identified large files in the repository
   - Verified that build artifacts and node_modules were properly ignored in .gitignore

2. **Created a fresh Git repository**:
   - Removed the existing .git directory to eliminate all Git history
   - Initialized a new Git repository
   - Added the remote repository URL: https://github.com/enrichmeai/coding-test.git

3. **Committed and pushed the code**:
   - Added all files to the staging area, excluding those specified in .gitignore
   - Committed the files with an appropriate commit message
   - Successfully pushed the commit to the GitHub repository

## Results

The repository was successfully pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/enrichmeai/coding-test.git. The push operation completed without any errors, and the code is now available on GitHub.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Keep repositories clean**: Avoid committing large files or directories (like node_modules) to Git repositories.
2. **Use .gitignore properly**: Ensure that .gitignore is set up correctly before making the first commit.
3. **Consider Git LFS**: For repositories that must include large files, consider using Git Large File Storage (LFS).
4. **Fresh start when needed**: Sometimes, starting with a fresh repository is the simplest solution to complex Git history issues.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular maintenance**: Periodically check the repository size and clean up any unnecessary files.
2. **Automated checks**: Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to prevent large files from being committed.
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with any special requirements or procedures for the repository.
