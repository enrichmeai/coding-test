# UI Tests Added

This document describes the UI tests that have been added back to the project.

## Overview

The UI tests for the City Letter Finder application have been recreated and added back to the project. These tests ensure that the frontend JavaScript functionality works correctly.

## Test File

The tests are located in:
- `src/test/resources/static/script.test.js`

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following functionality:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validating that only single letters (A-Z, a-z) are accepted
   - Showing appropriate validation messages for valid and invalid input

2. **UI Interaction**
   - Clearing the form and resetting the UI
   - Showing loading indicators during data fetching
   - Displaying results and error messages

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Fetching city counts for a given letter
   - Fetching city lists for a given letter
   - Handling successful responses
   - Handling error responses

## Test Implementation

The tests use Jest as the testing framework and include:

- Mocking of the DOM structure to match the actual HTML
- Mocking of the fetch API for testing API interactions
- Simulation of user interactions (clicks, input changes)
- Assertions to verify the expected behavior

## Running the Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all the UI tests and display the results.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the UI tests could include:

1. Integration tests that test the frontend and backend together
2. End-to-end tests using tools like Cypress or Selenium
3. Visual regression tests to ensure the UI looks correct
