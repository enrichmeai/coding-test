# Git Repository Cleanup

This document describes the steps that were taken to clean up the Git repository and make it possible to push to GitHub.

## Issue

The repository was too large to push to GitHub because it included the `node_modules` directory in its history. Even though `node_modules` was properly ignored in `.gitignore`, the files were still in the Git history from previous commits.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to clean up the repository:

1. Verified that `node_modules` was properly ignored in `.gitignore`
2. Identified that `node_modules` was in the Git history
3. Used `git filter-branch` to remove `node_modules` from the Git history
4. Ran `git gc --aggressive --prune=now` to clean up the repository

## Results

The size of the `.git` directory was reduced from 26MB to 6.5MB, making it possible to push to GitHub.

## Future Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always add `node_modules` to `.gitignore` before initializing a Git repository
2. Regularly check the size of the repository with `du -sh .git`
3. Use `git status` to ensure that no unwanted files are being tracked
