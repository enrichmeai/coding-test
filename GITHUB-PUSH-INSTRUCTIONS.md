# GitHub Push Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to push the repository to GitHub after the cleanup.

## Prerequisites

1. You have a GitHub account
2. You have created a repository on GitHub named `city-letter-finder`
3. You have the necessary permissions to push to this repository

## Instructions

Now that the repository has been cleaned up and its size has been reduced, you should be able to push it to GitHub. Here are the steps:

1. Ensure that the remote URL is correctly set:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   This should show the URL of your GitHub repository. If it doesn't, or if you want to change it, use:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/josepharuja/city-letter-finder.git
   ```
   Or, if you're using SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:josepharuja/city-letter-finder.git
   ```

2. Push the repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If you're using a different branch name, replace `main` with your branch name.

3. If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

4. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the GitHub documentation or contact your system administrator.

## Verification

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository at https://github.com/josepharuja/city-letter-finder to verify that your code has been successfully pushed.

## Note

If you still encounter issues with pushing to GitHub, it might be due to other large files in the repository that weren't identified during the cleanup. In that case, you might need to use Git LFS (Large File Storage) or perform a more thorough cleanup.
